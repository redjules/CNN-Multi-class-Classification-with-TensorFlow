# CNN Multi-class Classification with TensorFlow

In this exercise, you will be using the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the English alphabet.

You will need to pre-process the data so that it can be fed into your convolutional neural network to correctly classify each image as the letter it represents.


Let's get started!
